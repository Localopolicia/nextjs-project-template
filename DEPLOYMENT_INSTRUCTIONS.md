# Deployment Instructions for My App

## Build the App

Run the following command to build the app for production:

```
npm run build
```

## Start the Production Server

After building, start the production server with:

```
npm run start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Deployment

You can deploy this Next.js app to any hosting provider that supports Node.js, such as:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (recommended for Next.js apps)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- Custom servers

### Vercel Deployment

1. Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
2. Import your GitHub repository.
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js app and set up build and start commands.
4. Deploy the app with zero configuration.

## Environment Variables

If you add environment variables, create a `.env` file and configure them in your hosting provider.

## Notes

- The app uses remote images from `images.pexels.com`, which is allowed in `next.config.ts`.
- The app uses Tailwind CSS and other dependencies as specified in `package.json`.
